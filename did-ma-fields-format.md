# did:ma Extension Fields (ma namespace)

Version: 0.0.4
Status: Draft

## Abstract

This document defines method-specific fields under top-level ma in did:ma
documents.

This revision restores inbox as required address field and keeps transports as
lane capability hints.

## 1. Namespace Rules

1. All did:ma method-specific fields MUST be inside top-level ma.
1. ma MUST be a JSON object when present.
1. Unknown ma fields SHOULD be ignored unless a stricter profile says otherwise.

## 2. Common Field Definitions

| Property | JSON Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type | type | string | Subject type label. Allowed: world, agent, avatar, room, object. |
| Inbox | inbox | string | Canonical message address for this subject. |
| World | world | string | World DID root that this subject belongs to or targets. |
| Language | language | string | Preferred GNU LANGUAGE list, for example nb_NO:en_UK:en. |
| Requested TTL | requestedTTL | integer | Preferred retention/caching window in seconds. |
| Transports | transports | array of strings | Addressable transport endpoints for this DID subject. |
| Version | version | integer | Optional schema/profile compatibility marker. |

Notes:

1. inbox is canonical and SHOULD be present for all types in this profile.
1. currentInbox MUST NOT be used.
1. presenceHint MUST NOT be used.

## 3. Transport Format and ALPN Registry

### 3.1 Transport String Format

Each transports entry MUST use this form:

  /ma-iroh/<endpoint-id>/<alpn>

Where:

1. endpoint-id is the iroh endpoint identifier.
1. alpn is the lane identifier.

Example:

  /ma-iroh/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef/ma/inbox/1

### 3.2 Minimal ALPN Set (Current Profile)

Required now:

1. ma/inbox/1

Optional runtime lanes (if supported by deployment):

1. ma/presence/1
1. ma/broadcast/1
1. ma/whisper/1
1. ma/ipfs/1

ma/ipfs/1 note:

1. MAY be offered as a public service for DID publish requests when clients lack
  direct Kubo access.
1. Availability is deployment-policy controlled (ACL/rate limits/quota).

Guidance:

1. New documents SHOULD prefer only ma/inbox/1 unless extra lanes are needed.
1. Consumers SHOULD iterate transports and use the first ALPN they support.

## 4. Type Profiles

| ma.type | Required | Recommended | Optional | Forbidden/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| world | `type=world`, `inbox`, `transports` (must include at least one `ma/inbox/1`) | `language`, `version` | `requestedTTL` | `world` SHOULD NOT be set (self-reference redundant). |
| agent | `type=agent`, `inbox`, `transports` (must include at least one `ma/inbox/1`) | `language`, `version` | `requestedTTL` | `world` MUST NOT be set. Agent publishes transports like a world node. |
| avatar | `type=avatar`, `inbox`, `world` | `transports`, `version` | `language`, `requestedTTL` | If `transports` omitted, routing resolves via `world` transports. |
| room | `type=room`, `inbox`, `world` | `transports`, `version` | `language`, `requestedTTL` | If `transports` omitted, routing resolves via `world` transports. |
| object | `type=object`, `inbox`, `world` | `transports`, `version` | `language`, `requestedTTL` | If `transports` omitted, routing resolves via `world` transports. |

## 5. Validation Rules

1. type MUST be one of: world, agent, avatar, room, object.
1. inbox MUST be non-empty for all types in this profile.
1. If world is present, it MUST be a valid did:ma root DID.
1. If type is agent, world MUST NOT be present.
1. transports MUST be an array of non-empty strings when present.
1. Each transport entry SHOULD follow /ma-iroh/<endpoint-id>/<alpn>.
1. requestedTTL MUST be a non-negative integer when present.

## 6. DID Document Requirement by Type

This section defines whether a subject type must be represented by its own DID
document.

| Type | Own DID Document |
| --- | --- |
| world | REQUIRED |
| agent | REQUIRED |
| avatar | OPTIONAL |
| room | OPTIONAL |
| object | OPTIONAL |

Rules for optional types:

1. If transports is omitted, world MUST be present.
1. Consumers MUST use world DID document transports to deliver messages.
1. inbox remains required as canonical address even when transport is inherited.

## 7. Examples (ma section only)

  }
}
```

## 8. Correlation With Base DID Format

Base DID format remains authoritative for:

1. @context, id, controller
1. verificationMethod, assertionMethod, keyAgreement
1. proof
1. serialization rules
